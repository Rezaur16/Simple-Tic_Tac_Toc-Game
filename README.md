# Simple-Tic_Tac_Toc-Game
Overview:
"This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed during my 3rd-semester Object-Oriented Programming Language Course. It offers an interactive gaming experience where players can compete against each other in the classic Tic-Tac-Toe board."

Features:
Player vs. Player mode allowing two human players to take turns.
A clean and intuitive user interface for gameplay.
Win detection functionality to declare the winner and handle draws.
Potential future additions: AI opponent, score tracking, customizable game boards.
Technologies/Languages Used:
"Built using Java programming language for the core logic and Swing library for the graphical user interface."

Instructions:
"To play the game, run the main file and follow the on-screen instructions. Each player takes turns marking the grid with 'red' or 'blue' until a player wins or the game ends in a draw."

Challenges:
"During development, implementing the win detection algorithm and ensuring a smooth user experience were some challenges. Referring to object-oriented principles helped in structuring the code effectively."

Future Improvements:
"Future plans for this project include enhancing the game with an AI opponent for single-player mode and implementing score tracking to keep a record of player performance."
